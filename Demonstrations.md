# The Speech Control Demo #

In this Demo, the user is able to control several parts of eclipse via speech commands.
In principle, it is possible to trigger all of the defined eclipse commands in this way. The speech command to trigger the execution of such commands is always the name of the respective eclipse command. Examples for this could be: "Key Assistant", "Content Assistant", "Debug", "Open Call Hirachy", "Stop Speech Control", "Start Skeleton Tracking", ...

However, there is a limitation on which commands are executable via Speech Control: It is not possible to trigger commands, which need to be parameterized.

To start and stop the speech control demo, klick the respective buttons in the eclipse main window toolbar.
