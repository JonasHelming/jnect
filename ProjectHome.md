This project provides an Eclipse Plug-In interoperating with the Microsoft Kinect SDK. This way you can create applications using the body tracking and speech abilities of the Kinect using Java and Eclipse RCP. As we provide a JNI wrapper for the original SDK, it needs to be installed, which currently requires Windows 7.
