# Introduction #

With e4 it is very easy to modify the application. Together with Jnect you can create awesome demonstrations.


# Installation #

For using Jnect with e4 follow [this](http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/jnect/wiki/Installation) installation description.

But you only have to install the Jnect API Feature. Not the Jnect Demo Feature.

After that checkout the org.jnect.demo.e4 .

The demo contains a product. You can run it to get a feeling of what is possible with nearly no coding.
